# Modelling the Effects of Mass Electric Vehicle Penetration on the Irish Distribution System using OpenDSS

Ireland like many countries is aiming to decarbonise its tranport sector through the use of electrci transport. However the effects of mass uncontrolled charging could have a dramatic effect on the longevity and stability of the distrbution system.

This project modelled and simulated the effects of mass charging on the UCD Belfield Campus under a number of different scenarios.
